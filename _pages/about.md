I am currently pursuing a PhD in robotics and computer vision at the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en). I am part of the Mobile Robotics and Intelligent Systems group at the [Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI)](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) based in Barcelona. My work primarily centers on developing ego-motion estimation algorithms for event cameras, utilizing deep learning, especially Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), to enable more efficient and biologically inspired computational models for visual processing in dynamic environments.
 
Before starting my PhD, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Aircraft Design and Engineering from Beihang University in Beijing, China and have experience working as an aeronautical engineer at a commercial aircraft design company in Shanghai. In 2017, I relocated to Spain and obtained a Master's degree in European Union–China: Culture and Economy from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), where my final project involved conducting an in-depth market analysis of drone technologies in the European Union. Subsequently I earned a second Master's degree in Applications and Technologies of Unmanned Aircraft Systems from UPC, where I focused on SLAM and sensor fusion techniques for indoor drone navigation.
