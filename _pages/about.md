I am currently a phd student in robotics and computer vision from Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). I am working in the mobile robotics and intelligent systems group in [Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI)](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) based in Barcelona. I work on ego motion estimation algorithms for event camera using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN).
 
Previously, I got a bacherlor degree in Aeronautics engineering from Beihang University, then worked for an Commercial aircraft company. I moved to Spain in 2017, and got a Master degree in European Union–China: Culture and Economy in UAB, where I did a drone market analysis in EU for my final project. Subsequently, I got a Master degree in Applications and tecnologies of Unmanned Aircraft Systems from Polytechnic University of Catalonia, where I worked on SLAM and sensor fusion methods for drones in indoor environments.
